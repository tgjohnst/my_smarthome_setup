# Home Media Center Services (docker)

Here are all the services I currently run on my home server (NAS). These are all available as docker containers, and devops-automated via [docker compose](docker_services/docker-compose.yml). 

When combined, these allow me to
- Have a unified homepage that contains every web service I'm running on my home network
- Monitor and manage these services themselves
- Stream media to any of my devices via a netflix-like interface and app
- Automatically organize, catalog, manage, and fetch media (movies, TV, music, books)
